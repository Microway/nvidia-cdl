NVIDIA CUDA device list

Gathers device information and compiles a report with enumerated devices in an order consistent with CUDA API. Original `nvidia-smi` does not provide them in any particular order and this can be a problem on machines with multiple GPUs.

Provides the following information:
- Driver version
- GPU name
- GPU current temperature
- GPU UUID
- GPU PCI bus ID
- GPU memory usage

We also support data on actively running processes with command line arguments "--gpu=[number of CUDA device on which the process runs]" hoping that these processes run on the specified GPU.

To the staff of NVIDIA, thank you so very much for all of your help and expert assistance regarding this issue.
